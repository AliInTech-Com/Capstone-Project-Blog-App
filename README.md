# Capstone-Project-Blog-App

Hi! This is a simple Blog App, which is part of the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. It doesn't have a database attached to it, so I am storing content in arrays. For help, I did Google searches and explored different website code to create it. I have used Node.js and Express.js, as well as Bootstrap for styling.
